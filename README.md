# Fedora Copr Repository

This repository is to help me understand RPM packages and maintain some software I can't find in the official repositories.

The packages are built using [Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/) and are available for installation on Fedora systems. If you'd like to contribute or request a specific package, please [open an issue](https://github.com/guinuxbr/fedora-copr/issues).
